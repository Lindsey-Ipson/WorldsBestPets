                    <h3>Morita</h3> <br>
                    <p>Morita is from Buenos Aires, Argentina and is 6 years old. Morita loves: eating, sleeping, and occasional cuddles with her owners, but only on her own terms and conditions. Morita hates: bottoms of food bowls, the neighbor cats, and nail trims. Fun fact: Morita's name means "little berry" in Spanish.</p>

                    <p>Pepper is from New Jersey, USA, and is 2 years old. Pepper loves: attention, patrolling the neighborhood, and bike rides with her dad. Pepper hates: bathies, the neighbor cats, and when her sister, Morita, starts sniffing around her untouched dinner. Fun fact: Ask Pepper where her tail is, and she will do a little twirl and show you!</p>

                 <h3>The Rogers</h3> <br>
                 <p>The Rogers are 3 tiny garden snails all named Roger. They are from a backyard in Battersea, London, UK, and are 6 months old. The Rogers love: fresh lettuce, apple slices, and new sticks for their terrarium. The Rogers hate: direct sunlight, citrus foods, and when their owners are late in delivering their daily mists with the spray bottle.</p>

        <p>This month's Pet of the Month is...<span>The Rogers!</span></p> <br>
        <img src="images/MonthWinner.jpeg"> <br> <br> 
        <p>The Rogers win this month's Pet of the Month Award because they have caused their owners the lowest number of headaches these past few weeks. Requiring only fresh lettuce and terrarium cleans every couple days, and causing no other grievances to their owners, The Rogers finished miles ahead of the competition this month! Meanwhile, Pepper, with her frequent ultrasonic barking, and Morita, with her many nail scratching sessions on the door frame, have a long way to go if they wish to have a shot at winning next month's competition!</p>
